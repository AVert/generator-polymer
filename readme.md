# Polymer generator [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/generator-polymer.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/generator-polymer)

Scaffolds out [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org).

> Polymer is a new type of library for the web, built on top of Web Components, and designed to leverage the evolving web platform on modern browsers.

Polymer version: [v0.0.20130711](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/releases/tag/v0.0.20130711)

## Getting started

- Install: `npm install -g generator-polymer`
- Run it with [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo): `yo polymer`
